				<h1> Introduction </h1>
				<p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>

				<li> Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li> 

				<li> Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </li>

				<h1> Hello world </h1>
				<p> To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>

				<code>
					function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>
					greetMe("World");
				</code>

				<p> Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>

			<header id="variables">
				<h1> Variables </h1>
				<p> You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore ( _ ), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>

			<header id="declaring_variables">
				<h1> Declaring Variables </h1>
				<p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
				<li>  With the keyword var. For example, </li>

				<code> 
					var x = 42.
				</code>

				<p> This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. <p>
				<li> By simply assigning it a value. For example, </li>

				<code>
					x = 42. 
				</code>

				<p> This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. </p> 
				<li> With the keyword let. For example, </li>

				<code>
					let y = 13.
				</code>

				<p> This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>
			</header>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section">
			<header id="variable_scope">
				<h1> Variable Scope </h1>
				<p> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>

				<code>
					if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
				</code>

				<p> This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. </p>
